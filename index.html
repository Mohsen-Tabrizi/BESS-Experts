        <h2>About BESS Experts</h2>
        <p>
          BESS Experts is a media and knowledge platform created to give the Battery Energy Storage industry
          a clear and technically honest voice. The focus is on real applications, real challenges and real
          experience, not marketing buzzwords.
        </p>
        <p>
          The host combines more than 20 years in electrical engineering, photovoltaics and BESS with TÜV certified
          expertise and hands on EPC and commissioning work. The goal is simple: make it easier for manufacturers,
          EPCs, investors and operators to understand each other and to build better projects.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>What BESS Experts is not</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Not an EPC company and not a project competitor</li>
          <li>Not a sales channel for one manufacturer only</li>
          <li>Not pay to play content without technical depth</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          BESS Experts is a media platform first. EPC work and project execution are done separately through
          other entities so that this platform can stay neutral and open to everyone.
